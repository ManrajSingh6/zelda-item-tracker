# Zelda Item Tracker App

This app displays all items from the game, Zelda Breath of The Wild. Users are able to select different categories of items and view them in a user-friendly, card-based format. Each card provides essential information about the item.

All item information is retrieved using the Hyrule Compendium API linked [here.](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/)

## v1
The **v1** directory contains the first implementation when I was practicing React development. It only contains client side code.

## v2 [WIP]
The **v2** directory is currently a WIP, and will contain a client and GraphQL server that wraps the original REST API linked above. It also uses TypeScript!
