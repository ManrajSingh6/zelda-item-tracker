#Zelda BOTW Item Tracker App

This app displays all Zelda Breath of The Wild items. Users are able to select different categories of items and view them in a user-friendly, card-based format. Each card provides essential information about the item.

All item information is retrieved using the Hyrule Compendium API linked [here.](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/)

This was made to practice React development and uses the Material-UI framework for some components. 

It is currently a work-in-progress, and will be deployed soon.
